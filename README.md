# STM32F411 Receive Serial Communication (WIP)
Some work I started with making my STM32F411 receive data from my ![python serial monitor](https://github.com/DaveBben/python-system-monitor) and output it to a LCD screen. I eventually plan to also connect a NeoPixel Ring and use that to display CPU usage.
